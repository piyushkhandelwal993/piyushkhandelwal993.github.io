### **Topic: `toString()` Method in Java**

### **1. Introduction to `toString()` Method**
In Java, every object implicitly inherits from the `Object` class. The `toString()` method is defined in the `Object` class and is meant to return a string representation of an object. The default implementation of `toString()` returns a string that includes the class name and the object's hash code. However, it is often overridden to provide a more meaningful string representation of the object.

#### **1.1 Default Behavior of `toString()`**
By default, the `toString()` method provides information that might not be very useful:
```java
public class Car {
    private String brand;

    public Car(String brand) {
        this.brand = brand;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Car myCar = new Car("Toyota");
        System.out.println(myCar.toString());  // Output: Car@15db9742
    }
}
```
The output in this case will include the class name followed by the object’s memory address hash in hexadecimal format.

#### **1.2 Overriding `toString()`**
To make the `toString()` method more useful, we can override it in our class and return a string that contains relevant information about the object.
```java
public class Car {
    private String brand;
    private String model;

    public Car(String brand, String model) {
        this.brand = brand;
        this.model = model;
    }

    @Override
    public String toString() {
        return "Car [brand=" + brand + ", model=" + model + "]";
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Car myCar = new Car("Toyota", "Corolla");
        System.out.println(myCar.toString());  // Output: Car [brand=Toyota, model=Corolla]
    }
}
```

### **2. Key Points to Understand**
- **Default `toString()` behavior**: The default implementation returns a string consisting of the class name and the object’s hash code.
- **Overriding `toString()`**: To provide more useful output, override the method to return a custom string representation.
- **When to Override `toString()`**: Override `toString()` when you want to have a more meaningful, readable representation of an object, especially for debugging or logging purposes.

### **3. Edge Cases**
- **Null Reference Handling**: Ensure that fields used in the `toString()` method handle `null` values gracefully.
- **Circular References**: Be cautious about circular references between objects. This can lead to infinite loops in your `toString()` method if objects refer to each other.

### **4. Tricky Concepts**
- **Calling `toString()` Implicitly**: In Java, the `toString()` method is called implicitly when printing an object. For example:
  ```java
  System.out.println(myCar);  // Automatically calls myCar.toString()
  ```
- **Using `super.toString()`**: If overriding a subclass, you might want to incorporate the parent class’s `toString()` by calling `super.toString()` in your overridden method.

### **5. Exceptions**
- **StackOverflowError**: Be mindful of recursive references. If two objects refer to each other and their `toString()` methods reference each other, you could end up with a `StackOverflowError`.

### **Coding Exercises**

#### **Exercise 1**: Basic `toString()` Override
Create a `Person` class with fields for name and age. Override the `toString()` method to return the person's details in a meaningful way.
```java
public class Person {
    private String name;
    private int age;

    public Person(String name, int age) {
        this.name = name;
        this.age = age;
    }

    @Override
    public String toString() {
        return "Person [name=" + name + ", age=" + age + "]";
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Person person = new Person("John", 25);
        System.out.println(person);
    }
}
```

#### **Exercise 2**: Handling `null` in `toString()`
Modify the `Person` class to handle a possible `null` value for the name field in the `toString()` method.
```java
@Override
public String toString() {
    String displayName = (name != null) ? name : "Unknown";
    return "Person [name=" + displayName + ", age=" + age + "]";
}
```

#### **Exercise 3**: Using `super.toString()`
Create a class `Employee` that extends `Person`. In the `Employee` class, override the `toString()` method and call `super.toString()` to include the parent class’s string representation.
```java
public class Employee extends Person {
    private String position;

    public Employee(String name, int age, String position) {
        super(name, age);
        this.position = position;
    }

    @Override
    public String toString() {
        return super.toString() + ", position=" + position;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Employee emp = new Employee("Alice", 30, "Manager");
        System.out.println(emp);
    }
}
```

### **Summary**
- The `toString()` method is crucial for providing a string representation of an object.
- It is important to override this method for better readability and debugging.
- Handle `null` values and avoid recursive calls in your overridden `toString()` methods to prevent potential issues like `StackOverflowError`.
