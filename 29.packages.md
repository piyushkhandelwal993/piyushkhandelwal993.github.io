### Topic: **Packages in Java**

### **Introduction to Packages in Java**

A **package** in Java is a namespace that organizes a set of related classes and interfaces. Think of it as a folder in a file directory where related files are grouped together. Packages help in avoiding name conflicts and make it easier to locate and use classes, interfaces, enums, and sub-packages.

Java provides two types of packages:
1. **Built-in packages** (e.g., `java.util`, `java.io`).
2. **User-defined packages**, created by the developer.

### **1. Why Use Packages?**
- **Namespace Management**: Packages prevent name conflicts. For example, you can have a `Car` class in both `vehicles` and `toys` packages.
- **Modularization**: Related classes can be grouped in one package, making the code modular.
- **Access Control**: Packages help control the visibility of classes and members using access modifiers.

### **2. Structure of a Package**
A package follows the directory structure of the file system. The general syntax for declaring a package at the top of a Java file is:

```java
package packageName;
```

For example:

```java
package com.myapp.models;
```

The `com.myapp.models` directory must exist in your project structure, and the class that belongs to this package will reside in this folder.

---

### **3. Importing Packages**
To use a class from another package, you need to import it. Importing a class or an entire package is done using the `import` statement.

- Importing a specific class:

```java
import java.util.ArrayList;
```

- Importing all classes from a package:

```java
import java.util.*;
```

---

### **4. Built-in Packages**
Java provides several built-in packages, including:
- **`java.lang`** (automatically imported): Contains fundamental classes such as `String`, `Math`, `Object`.
- **`java.util`**: Provides utility classes such as `ArrayList`, `HashMap`, `Date`.
- **`java.io`**: For input/output operations, such as file handling.

---

### **5. Creating a User-Defined Package**
1. **Create a package**: You can create a package using the `package` keyword at the start of your class file.

   Example:
   ```java
   package myapp.utilities;

   public class MathHelper {
       public static int add(int a, int b) {
           return a + b;
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Compile the package**: The directory structure should reflect the package name.
   - `myapp/utilities/MathHelper.java`

3. **Using the package**: To use the class in another file, import the package.

   Example:
   ```java
   import myapp.utilities.MathHelper;

   public class Test {
       public static void main(String[] args) {
           int sum = MathHelper.add(5, 10);
           System.out.println("Sum: " + sum);
       }
   }
   ```

### **6. Access Modifiers in Packages**
Packages work hand-in-hand with **access modifiers** in Java:
- **`public`**: Classes and members are accessible from any other class.
- **`protected`**: Accessible within the same package and by subclasses.
- **`no modifier`** (default): Accessible only within the same package.
- **`private`**: Not accessible from other classes.

---

### **Edge Cases & Tricky Concepts**
1. **Package Naming Conflicts**: Ensure packages have unique names, especially when using third-party libraries.
2. **Access Modifiers and Sub-packages**: Classes in sub-packages are not considered part of the parent package for default (package-private) access.
3. **Cyclic Dependencies**: Avoid creating circular dependencies between packages.

---

### **Common Exceptions**
1. **`ClassNotFoundException`**: This occurs when you attempt to import a class that doesn't exist or isn't available in the classpath.
2. **`NoClassDefFoundError`**: This happens when a class has been compiled but is not found at runtime.

---

### **Checkpoint Questions**
1. What is a package, and why do we use it in Java?
2. How does the `import` statement work in Java?
3. What is the difference between importing a single class and importing all classes in a package?

---

### **Post-Lecture Questions**
1. Explain the role of the `java.lang` package. Why is it automatically imported?
2. How do access modifiers affect class visibility across packages?
3. What happens when two packages have classes with the same name? How can we resolve the conflict?

---

### **Coding Exercises**

#### Exercise 1: Create a User-Defined Package
1. Create a package named `math.operations`.
2. In this package, create two classes:
   - `Addition` with a method `add(int a, int b)` that returns the sum of two numbers.
   - `Multiplication` with a method `multiply(int a, int b)` that returns the product of two numbers.
3. Create a main class in a different package that imports and uses both classes.

---

#### Exercise 2: Handling Access Modifiers
1. Create two packages, `shapes` and `mainapp`.
2. In `shapes`, create a class `Circle` with:
   - A private field `radius`.
   - A public constructor and a public method `calculateArea()`.
3. In `mainapp`, create a class that tries to access the `Circle` class and its methods. Experiment with changing the access modifiers.

---

#### Exercise 3: Working with Built-in Packages
1. Write a program that uses the `java.util.ArrayList` to store a list of integers.
2. Use the `java.util.Collections` class to sort the list and print the result.
