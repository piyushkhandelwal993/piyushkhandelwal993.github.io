### Topic: Access Control in Java  


### Introduction

Access control in Java is an important aspect of object-oriented programming, as it ensures encapsulation and controls how classes interact with one another. Java provides four levels of access control:

1. **Private** (`private`)
2. **Default (Package-private)`** (no modifier)
3. **Protected** (`protected`)
4. **Public** (`public`)

In this lesson, we will explore these access modifiers using a single example that we extend step by step to showcase how each modifier works in different scenarios.

### Step-by-Step Example: Access Control

#### Step 1: Defining a Class with **Private** Access

We start by defining a class called `Person` in the package `com.example` with private members.

```java
// File: com/example/Person.java
package com.example;

public class Person {
    private String name;
    private int age;

    // Constructor
    public Person(String name, int age) {
        this.name = name;
        this.age = age;
    }

    // Private method
    private void displayPrivate() {
        System.out.println("Name: " + name + ", Age: " + age);
    }

    // Public method to access private members
    public void showDetails() {
        displayPrivate();
    }
}
```

- **Private Access**: The fields `name` and `age` are private and can only be accessed within the `Person` class. The `displayPrivate()` method is also private and can only be called inside the `Person` class.

**Attempting to access these private members from outside the `Person` class will result in a compilation error.**

```java
// File: Main.java
import com.example.Person;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Person person = new Person("John", 25);
        person.showDetails(); // Valid, public method
        // person.displayPrivate(); // Error: displayPrivate() has private access in Person
    }
}
```

#### Step 2: Adding **Default (Package-private)** Access

Now, we introduce a second class `Employee` in the same package, `com.example`, without specifying any access modifier for its fields and methods. By default, these will have package-private access.

```java
// File: com/example/Employee.java
package com.example;

class Employee {
    String employeeId;
    int salary;

    // Constructor
    Employee(String employeeId, int salary) {
        this.employeeId = employeeId;
        this.salary = salary;
    }

    void displayDefault() {
        System.out.println("Employee ID: " + employeeId + ", Salary: " + salary);
    }
}
```

- **Default (Package-private) Access**: The fields `employeeId` and `salary` and the `displayDefault()` method are package-private, meaning they are accessible only within the `com.example` package.

```java
// File: Main.java
import com.example.Person;
import com.example.Employee; // Note: No import error since it's in the same package

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Person person = new Person("John", 25);
        person.showDetails(); // Public method works

        Employee emp = new Employee("E123", 50000);
        emp.displayDefault(); // Works, as it's within the same package
    }
}
```

**Attempting to access `Employee` from a different package would result in a compilation error, as `Employee` has package-private access.**

#### Step 3: Adding **Protected** Access

Next, we extend the `Person` class into another package called `com.example.sub` and demonstrate the `protected` access modifier.

```java
// File: com/example/sub/Manager.java
package com.example.sub;

import com.example.Person;

public class Manager extends Person {
    protected String department;

    // Constructor
    public Manager(String name, int age, String department) {
        super(name, age);
        this.department = department;
    }

    protected void displayProtected() {
        System.out.println("Department: " + department);
    }

    // Accessing protected member from subclass
    public void showAllDetails() {
        showDetails(); // Calling parent's public method
        displayProtected(); // Calling this class's protected method
    }
}
```

- **Protected Access**: The `department` field and `displayProtected()` method are marked as `protected`, allowing them to be accessed within the `Manager` class (even though it's in a different package) and by any class that extends `Manager`.

```java
// File: SubMain.java
package com.example.sub;

public class SubMain {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Manager manager = new Manager("Alice", 40, "IT");
        manager.showAllDetails(); // Accessing protected members from subclass
        // manager.displayProtected(); // Error: displayProtected() has protected access
    }
}
```

**Protected members can only be accessed through inheritance, not by direct instantiation of the parent class from a different package.**

#### Step 4: **Public** Access

Finally, we make certain members `public` to allow access from anywhere in the application.

```java
// File: com/example/sub/Manager.java
package com.example.sub;

public class Manager extends Person {
    public String department;

    // Constructor
    public Manager(String name, int age, String department) {
        super(name, age);
        this.department = department;
    }

    public void displayPublic() {
        System.out.println("Department: " + department);
    }

    @Override
    public void showDetails() {
        super.showDetails(); // Calling the parent's method
        displayPublic(); // Public method, accessible everywhere
    }
}
```

- **Public Access**: The `department` field and `displayPublic()` method are now `public`, meaning they can be accessed from any class, anywhere.

```java
// File: GlobalMain.java
import com.example.sub.Manager;

public class GlobalMain {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Manager manager = new Manager("Alice", 40, "IT");
        manager.showDetails(); // Works, public method
        System.out.println("Department: " + manager.department); // Works, public field
    }
}
```

### Summary of Access Modifiers

| Access Modifier | Same Class | Same Package | Subclass (Different Package) | Anywhere |
|-----------------|------------|--------------|-----------------------------|---------|
| Private         | Yes        | No           | No                          | No      |
| Default         | Yes        | Yes          | No                          | No      |
| Protected       | Yes        | Yes          | Yes                         | No      |
| Public          | Yes        | Yes          | Yes                         | Yes     |

### Edge Cases and Interview Questions

1. **Access in Inheritance**: Private members are not inherited, but protected members are. However, protected members can only be accessed through inheritance.

   **Interview Question**: Can a subclass in a different package access the protected method of its parent class without inheritance?

2. **Default Access Limitation**: Members with default access can only be accessed within the same package. This restricts package design, making it ideal for tightly coupled package-level classes.

   **Interview Question**: What are the implications of using default access modifier for classes in a public API?

---

### Coding Exercises

1. **Exercise 1: Private and Public Access**
   - Modify the `Person` class to include a private field `address` and a public getter method to access it. Test accessing this field from a different class.

2. **Exercise 2: Package-Private Access**
   - Create a new class `Department` in the `com.example` package with default access. Try accessing its members from both inside and outside the package.

3. **Exercise 3: Protected Access**
   - Create a `Product` class in a new package with protected methods and extend it in another package. Try accessing the protected methods from the subclass and from other classes.

### Checkpoint Questions
1. *What will happen if a private method is accessed from another class in the same package?*
2. *Can you access a default member in a subclass from a different package?*
3. *How does protected access help in designing inheritance hierarchies?*
