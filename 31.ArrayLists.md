### Introduction to ArrayLists
An **ArrayList** in Java is a resizable array-like data structure that allows you to store elements dynamically. Unlike arrays, which are fixed in size, ArrayLists can grow and shrink in size at runtime.

#### Key Differences Between Arrays and ArrayLists:
1. **Size**: Arrays have a fixed size, while ArrayLists are dynamic.
2. **Type**: Arrays can hold both primitive types and objects, whereas ArrayLists can only hold objects (but autoboxing allows storage of primitives in an object form).
3. **Flexibility**: ArrayLists allow easy insertion, deletion, and access of elements.

### Internal Working of ArrayLists
- **Underlying Structure**: Internally, an ArrayList is backed by an array. When the ArrayList exceeds its current capacity, it creates a new larger array and copies the elements from the old array to the new one.
- **Dynamic Resizing**: When an ArrayList's capacity is exceeded, its size increases by 50% of its previous size. This process of resizing is computationally expensive because it involves creating a new array and copying all the elements.
- **Indexing**: Like arrays, ArrayLists allow indexed access to elements. The time complexity of getting an element at a given index is O(1), while insertion and deletion may take O(n) due to shifting elements.

### Key Methods of ArrayList
1. **add(E element)**: Adds the specified element to the end of the ArrayList.
   ```java
   ArrayList<Integer> list = new ArrayList<>();
   list.add(10); // Adds 10 to the ArrayList
   ```

2. **add(int index, E element)**: Inserts the specified element at the specified position in the ArrayList.
   ```java
   list.add(1, 20); // Inserts 20 at index 1
   ```

3. **get(int index)**: Returns the element at the specified index.
   ```java
   int value = list.get(1); // Retrieves the element at index 1
   ```

4. **remove(int index)**: Removes the element at the specified index.
   ```java
   list.remove(1); // Removes the element at index 1
   ```

5. **size()**: Returns the number of elements in the ArrayList.
   ```java
   int size = list.size(); // Returns the size of the ArrayList
   ```

6. **contains(Object o)**: Returns true if the ArrayList contains the specified element.
   ```java
   boolean exists = list.contains(10); // Checks if 10 is in the ArrayList
   ```

7. **clear()**: Removes all elements from the ArrayList.
   ```java
   list.clear(); // Empties the ArrayList
   ```

8. **isEmpty()**: Checks if the ArrayList is empty.
   ```java
   boolean isEmpty = list.isEmpty(); // Returns true if the list is empty
   ```

### Tricky Concepts and Edge Cases

1. **ConcurrentModificationException**:
   If you modify an ArrayList while iterating over it using an iterator, Java throws a `ConcurrentModificationException`.
   ```java
   for (Integer value : list) {
       list.add(30); // This will throw a ConcurrentModificationException
   }
   ```

2. **Null Elements**:
   ArrayLists can store null values, and accessing or modifying null values can lead to `NullPointerException` if not handled carefully.
   ```java
   list.add(null);
   ```

3. **IndexOutOfBoundsException**:
   Trying to access an invalid index will result in an `IndexOutOfBoundsException`.
   ```java
   list.get(10); // Throws IndexOutOfBoundsException if the size of the list is less than 11
   ```

4. **ArrayList Growth**:
   Though ArrayLists grow dynamically, repeated resizing may lead to performance degradation, especially in scenarios involving frequent insertions. One can initialize an ArrayList with a specific capacity to avoid this.
   ```java
   ArrayList<Integer> list = new ArrayList<>(100); // Initializes with capacity of 100
   ```

5. **Type Safety**:
   ArrayLists are type-safe when generics are used. However, without generics, they can lead to `ClassCastException`.
   ```java
   ArrayList rawList = new ArrayList();
   rawList.add("String");
   Integer value = (Integer) rawList.get(0); // ClassCastException
   ```

### Coding Exercises

1. **Exercise 1**:
   Write a Java program to create an ArrayList of integers, add elements, and remove an element at a specific index. Also, check if a particular element exists in the ArrayList.
   ```java
   ArrayList<Integer> numbers = new ArrayList<>();
   numbers.add(5);
   numbers.add(10);
   numbers.remove(0); // Removes the first element
   ```

2. **Exercise 2**:
   Create an ArrayList of strings, and use a for loop to iterate through it and print each string. Modify the ArrayList during iteration and handle `ConcurrentModificationException`.
   ```java
   ArrayList<String> fruits = new ArrayList<>();
   fruits.add("Apple");
   fruits.add("Banana");
   // Use Iterator to modify while iterating
   ```

3. **Exercise 3**:
   Write a program that initializes an ArrayList with a capacity of 100 and adds elements until its size exceeds 150. Print the capacity and size after each insertion.
   ```java
   ArrayList<Integer> list = new ArrayList<>(100);
   // Add elements and observe how the capacity changes
   ```
